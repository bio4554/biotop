/*

This header file defines the various custom data types used in CRPG.



The location system in this game is called a "Timeline" system. This means that the game progresses on a linear timeline.
Positions in the timeline are stored as numbers that range from 1 to a set limit (The timeline_limit variable)
Locations can either be a road or a town. Here is an example timeline:

    1 -------- 2 -------- 3 -------- 4 -------- 5  	<-- Location on timeline (stored as an int)
 Town 1     Road 1     Town 2     Road 3     Boss 1
